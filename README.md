## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to providing the latest and most relevant resources on AGI to keep you informed and inspired. While there is debate on the definition of AGI, practitioners take it to their IDEs and Terminals to harness the power of LLMs with outer-loops (and soon other LLMs) to inch closer and closer to AGI. 


## üåå Reasoning Systems

Most recent developments on top, as obsolecence is quick in this space, because of the breadth and speed of innovation.
